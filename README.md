# Term Project - My portfolio app

## About

This is the final term project for CS601. This is an app that showcases all the topics that I have mastered and applied using the knowledge I and learned about
web languages, HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, React, web page layout and design, Document Object Model, Website usability, and Project management for web design and development. The website consists of 6 individual content pages that feature a homepage, about me section, my interests, my resume, a gallery, and a contact form. 

## Accessibility

This webpage is hosted on github webpages and can be accessed at https://tsaik9520.github.io/my-portfolio-app/

## Problems & Learnings

> This term project was really fun to make and I was able to demonstrate the culmination of my learnings through these 6 weeks of class. I was able to express my own style and interests into my first own portfolio that I can now put on my resume

> I really enjoyed coding in React the most. I thought in the beginning that the creating a bunch of HTML pages then the javascript would be very tedious but React has made the creation of this project so much easier along with routes.

> Some features that I implemented that I was really excited were the scroll to top buttom on the interests and gallery page implemented using eventlisteners. I also was really happy about the outcome of the image modal as showcased in the gallery page and the download button on the resume page. I also implemented the following features from previous weeks assignments:
-  CSS flexboxes, Webstructures, Combinators, Pseudoclasses, and group selectors (module 3)
-  React JS (module 5)
-  Dynamic JSON data retrieval (module 2)
-  Interactive form submission with client-side validation and DOM manipulation (module 1)
-  React form and routes (module 6)

> I was cut short on time but I planned to implement a database setup with an EC2 instance to host a small database to store the contact information as the backend. I also wanted to store the images on a S3 bucket in the cloud so I wouldnt have to retrieve locally. Those would be some future improvements for this website.

## Sources/Credits

I used the lecture code, w3 schools demo, and previous code on assignments for the basis of this project

In addition, I referenced all of the facilitator sessions to help build the javascript
